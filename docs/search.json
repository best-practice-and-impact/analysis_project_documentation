    "text": "Definitions\nAssumptions are scored as Red, Amber or Green (a RAG rating) depending on quality. In RAG, green denotes a favourable value, red unfavourable and amber neutral. The quality of an assumption measures both how certain and robust an assumption is and how appropriate it is for its intended use.\nFor example, we would usually consider a well documented assumption drawn from published evidence to be very robust, but if it needs to be transformed or adapted significantly to fit the analysis, the quality rating might need downgrading.\nYou would normally lower the quality rating of an assumption if you cannot get technical sign-off (for example because of lack of technical knowledge) or if the information on which it is based is incomplete or poor quality. You would also normally lower the quality if the confidence interval or uncertainty range is wide (i.e. you wouldn’t be surprised if the value was 50% different from what you measure because of uncertainty).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRAG Rating\nAssumption quality\n\n\n\n\nGREEN\nBased on validated data; Methodology is robust; No or few transformations, or transformation methodology is fully verified

    "text": "IV. Delivery\n\nQuality questions and why they matterThe questions and the Code of PracticeLinking the questions to AQuA roles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuality Question\n\n\nWhy do I need to know the answer to this?\n\n\n\n\nQ53\n\n\nCan you give a clear account of what can and cannot be inferred from the analysis?\n\n\nOften the aim of final output is to inform decison-making. Output might include predictions, involving lots of underlying assumptions. It is critical that you support your users to make appropriate use of outputs and understand what can and cannot be inferred. Without this, users may misinterpret findings, make in appropriate comparisons, use the analysis for unsuitable purposes and arrive at the wrong conclusions. For example, a non-expert user may wrongly interpret correlation as causation or use incomplete or disconnected data to make forecasts.\n\n\n\n\nQ54\n\n\nHave you assessed the limitations of the data and analysis and set out how they affect the quality and use of the outputs?\n\n\nYou should describe why limitations related to data and methods exist, why they cannot be overcome using the chosen approach and their impact on the quality and interpretation of the output. Analysis is of very little value if limitations aren’t properly documented and explained.\n\n\n\n\nQ55\n\n\nHave you sense checked outputs with user groups and stakeholders?\n\n\nYou should work with users, experts, and other relevant stakeholders to verify the credibility of outputs and sense check that they are useful.\n\n\n\n\nQ56\n\n\nIs uncertainty about data quality, assumptions and methodology clearly communicated to users?\n\n\nOutputs are never 100% accurate. Users need to understand how uncertainties related to data, assumptions and methodology feed into and through the analysis workflow and what this means for the use of the outputs. Results must clearly explain how uncertainty affects the findings from the analysis, or we risk misinterpretations and conclusions being overly reliant on imprecise results.\n\n\n\n\nQ57\n\n\nAre the implications of unquantified uncertainties communicated to users?\n\n\nYou must support your users to understand relevant uncertainties which are not captured in the analysis. When you can, make reasonable judgements about the likely size and direction of unquantified uncertainty. Provide a qualitative description informing users about why the uncertainty cannot be quantified and their likely impact.\n\n\n\n\nQ58\n\n\nIs workflow documentation including technical guides and code repositories publicly available?\n\n\nTransparency about your analysis supports proper scrutiny and challenge, promotes public trust, and encourages re-use of the resources you develop.\n\n\n\n\nQ59\n\n\nDoes the technical guide and documentation explain how to run the analysis to obtain valid outputs?\n\n\nA good technical guide helps everybody to understand what the analysis does and how it works. A well-written technical guide is essential for effective maintenance of the analysis. It helps users of the analysis to replicate the findings, get answers to methodology questions and build their trust in the output.\n\n\n\n\nQ60\n\n\nHave you fully documented the analysis code to comply with good practice?\n\n\nThe technical guide is complemented by fully documented analysis code. Code documentation must comply with good practice so new users can understand and execute the code as easily and quickly as possible.\n\n\n\n\nQ61\n\n\nAre users able to feed back on the suitability of outputs?\n\n\nExternal critique makes analysis more robust. Users should be able to give feedback to your team to ensure that results meet their needs. User feedback and customer reviews inform you of issues and changes that you might need to make. They also act as evidence that users have been consulted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\nWhich pillar and principle of Code of Practice matter here?\n*Trustworthiness (T), Quality (Q), Value (V)\n\n\n\n\nQ53\n\n\nCan you give a clear account of what can and cannot be inferred from the analysis?\n\n\nQ2.4 Relevant limitations arising from the methods and their application, including bias and uncertainty, should be identified and explained to users. An indication of their likely scale and the steps taken to reduce their impact on the statistics should be included in the explanation.\n\n\n\n\nQ54\n\n\nHave you assessed the limitations of the data and analysis and set out how they affect the quality and use of the outputs?\n\n\nQ3 Producers of statistics and data should explain clearly how they assure themselves that statistics and data are accurate, reliable, coherent and timely.Q1.5 Potential bias, uncertainty and possible distortive effects in the source data should be identified and the extent of any impact on the statistics should be clearly reported.Q3.1 Statistics should be produced to a level of quality that meets users’ needs. The strengths and limitations of the statistics and data should be considered in relation to different uses, and clearly explained alongside the statistics.\n\n\n\n\nQ55\n\n\nHave you sense checked outputs with user groups and stakeholders?\n\n\nQ3 Producers of statistics and data should explain clearly how they assure themselves that statistics and data are accurate, reliable, coherent and timely.\n\n\n\n\nQ56\n\n\nIs uncertainty about data quality, assumptions and methodology clearly communicated to users?\n\n\nQ1.5 Potential bias, uncertainty and possible distortive effects in the source data should be identified and the extent of any impact on the statistics should be clearly reported.Q2.4 Relevant limitations arising from the methods and their application, including bias and uncertainty, should be identified and explained to users.

An indication of their likely scale and the steps taken to reduce their impact on the statistics should be included in the explanation.Q3.3 The extent and nature of any uncertainty in the estimates should be clearly explained.\n\n\n\n\nQ58\n\n\nIs documentation including technical guides and code repositories publicly available?\n\n\nV2 Statistics and data should be equally available to all, not given to some people before others. They should be published at a sufficient level of detail and remain publicly available.\n\n\n\n\nQ59\n\n\nDoes the technical guide and documentation explain how to run the analysis to obtain valid outputs?\n\n\nV2 Statistics and data should be equally available to all, not given to some people before others. They should be published at a sufficient level of detail and remain publicly available.V3 Statistics and data should be presented clearly, explained meaningfully and provide authoritative insights that serve the public good.\n\n\n\n\nQ60\n\n\nHave you fully documented the analysis code to comply with good practice?\n\n\nT4.4 Good business practices should be maintained in the use of resources. Where appropriate, statistics producers should take opportunities to share resources and collaborate to achieve common goals and produce coherent statistics.Q2.1 Methods and processes should be based on national or international good practice, scientific principles, or established professional consensus.\n\n\n\n\nQ61\n\n\nAre users able to feed back on the suitability of outputs?\n\n\nV1 Users of statistics and data should be at the centre of statistical production; their needs should be understood, their views sought and acted upon, and their use of statistics supported. V1.4 Statistics producers should engage publicly through a variety of means that are appropriate to the needs of different audiences and proportionate to the potential of the statistics to serve the public good. An open dialogue should be maintained using proactive formal and informal engagement to listen to the views of new and established contacts. Statistics producers should undertake public engagement collaboratively wherever possible, working in partnership with policy makers and other statistics producers to obtain the views of stakeholders.V1.5 The views received from users, potential users and other stakeholders should be addressed, where practicable. Statistics producers should consider whether to produce new statistics to meet identified information gaps. Feedback should be provided to them about how their needs can and cannot be met, being transparent about reasons for the decisions made and any constraints.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuality Question\n\n\nWhich AQuA role(s) would normally answer this?\n\n\nWhy are these AQuA roles involved?\n\n\n\n\nQ53\n\n\nCan you give a clear account of what can and cannot be inferred from the analysis?\n\n\nCommissioner, analyst\n\n\nDuring the delivery phase, the commissioner receives the results of the analysis and decides whether it meets their needs. The analyst provides sufficient information to support the commissioner to make an informed decision.\n\n\n\n\nQ54\n\n\nHave you assessed the limitations of the data and analysis and set out how they affect the quality and use of the outputs?\n\n\nCommissioner, analytical assurer, analyst\n\n\nThe commissioner must be confident in the quality of the outputs. They should understand the strengths, limitations and context of the analysis so that the results are correctly interpreted. Analytical assurer sign-off provides confidence that analysis risks, limitations and major assumptions are understood by the users of the analysis. Analysts make sure that the commissioner and analytical assurer have the evidence they need.\n\n\n\n\nQ55\n\n\nHave you sense checked outputs with user groups and stakeholders?\n\n\nAnalyst, analytical assurer\n\n\nThe analyst and analytical assurer should enable and encourage peer review. Peer reviews provide useful critical challenge about the analytical approach, application of methods and interpretation of the analysis. Verification and peer review of work should be done by analysts who had no involvemen in the work  so their views are independent.\n\n\n\n\nQ56\n\n\nIs uncertainty about data quality, assumptions and methodology clearly communicated to users?\n\n\nAnalyst, commissioner\n\n\nThe analyst must determine and communicate the uncertainty associated with the analysis so the commissioner can make informed decisions. The commissioner should ensure that an assessment of uncertainty has been provided and that the implications of uncertainty are understood.\n\n\n\n\nQ57\n\n\nAre the implications of unquantified uncertainties communicated to users?\n\n\nAnalyst, commissioner\n\n\nIf uncertainty is too complex to quantify, even approximately, the analysts should explain this so the commissioner can take this into account. In communicating analysis results to decision-makers and stakeholders, the commissioner should be open about the existence of deep uncertainties whose impact cannot be assessed, and explain how they are managed in the analysis.\n\n\n\n\nQ58\n\n\nIs documentation including technical guides and code repositories publicly available?\n\n\nAnalyst, analytical assurer\n\n\nThe analyst must produce appropriate design documentation. Best practice includes maintaining a record of the analysis workflow in a technical report, including a concept of analysis, user requirements, design specification, functional specification, data dictionary, and test plan. Code should be properly documented.\n\n\n\n\nQ59\n\n\nDoes the technical guide and documentation explain how to run the analysis to obtain valid outputs?\n\n\nAnalyst, analytical assurer\n\n\nThe analyst must produce appropriate documentation. Best practice includes maintaining a record of the work that has been done in a technical report, including a full description of the analysis, user requirements, design specification, functional specification, data dictionary, and test plan. The analytical assurer makes sure that the documentation is fit for purpose.\n\n\n\n\nQ60\n\n\nHave you fully documented the analysis code to comply with good practice?\n\n\nAnalyst, analytical assurer\n\n\nAnalysts should develop and maintain analysis code in line with best practice. Code must comply with relevant policies and standards.\n\n\n\n\nQ61\n\n\nIs there a clear feedback mechanism so users can report back on the suitability of outputs?\n\n\nAnalyst, senior responsible owner\n\n\nYou can assess the usefulness of the analysis by getting feedback from users, stakeholders and other experts. Quality analysis should be free of prejudice or bias. The SRO and analysts should check that the analysis follows the principles of RIGOUR (Repeatable, Independent, Grounded in reality, Objective, Uncertainty-managed, Robust)",

    "section": "Structure of the ONS Quality Questions",
    "text": "Structure of the ONS Quality Questions\nThere are 61 quality questions in total. They cover all the stages of the analytical cycle.\nAnswering 61 questions must seem quite daunting at first! The questions are designed to help you as you work your way through the analytical process, rather than to be answered all at once. Creating a log of answers as you move through the stages of the analysis workflow will help you to check that your work meets analytical standards, follows good practice and (if relevant) complies with the Code of Practice for Statistics.\nAnswering the questions will also help you make sure that everybody working on the analysis has a clear understanding of how and why it works as it does, and to support your users when writing your outputs. Moreover, most of the answers will help you to produce the critical documents that mitigate risk like an assumptions log, decisions log, issues log, and technical guides for your team and your users.\nThe AQuA book divides the analytical cycle into four stages:\n\nScoping\n\nDesign\n\nConducting and checking analysis\n\nDelivery\n\nYou can find the questions in the ONS Quality Questions section of the website. The questions have tabs which relate to three themes:\n\n\nTheme1: ONS Quality Questions and why they matter\n\nAlongside each question we explain why it matters and explain the potential risks and benefits around it. We try to address the very sensible question of “why should I care about this?”.\n\n\n\nTheme 2: The questions and the Code of Practice for Statistics\n\nEach question is linked with the Code of Practice for Statistics pillars of Trustworthiness, Quality and Value. We explain the importance and relevance of each question in light of the three pillars so teams can better understand and apply these principles through out the project life cycle.\nEven if your work does not directly feed into the production of official statistics, compliance with the principles and practices of the Code is a good way to strengthen the resilience of your work, increase transparency and clarity and reduce risk.\n\n\n\nTheme 3: Linking the questions to AQuA roles\n\nQuality questions are also linked to which responsible role from the AQuA book would usually answer them. The idea is to highlight the clear line of accountability set out in the AQuA book in an easy-to-understand manner. We want to make it easier for teams to decide how the three key assurance roles of commissioner, senior responsible owner (and their analysis team) and analytical assurer are covered in their own workflows.\nThe AQuA book sets out four roles that cover different areas of assurance responsibility. Taken together, they provide a comprehensive set of assurance for an analytical project. The roles are:\n\nCommissioner\n\nSenior Responsible Owner (SRO)\n\nAnalyst\n\nAnalytical assurer\n\nLet’s look at the roles more detail.\nResponsibilities of the Commissioner\nThe commissioner is focused on making sure the analysis meets the required user needs.\n* Ensures that context around the work is understood so quality assurance is appropriate and proportionate.\n* Ensures that there is enough time and resource for required assurance and account for risk.\n* Must understand strengths and limitations including uncertainty so results are interpreted correctly.\n* Delivers QUALITY OF OUTCOME (“The analysis meets user needs and we understand its limitations”).\nResponsibilities of the Senior Responsible Owner\nThe Senior Responsible Owner (SRO) is accountable for the analytical workflow throughout its lifecycle. The Senior Responsible Owner is usually a senior member of the analytical team, and works closely with (or manages) the analyst team.\nThere is no minimum grade for the SRO role, but they should have the expertise, resources and accountability to ensure that the analysis is well designed, complies with relevant standards, works as intended and is fit for purpose.\n* Signs off all important decisions made about the analysis to ensure that it is fit-for-purpose, prior to use.\n* Delivers QUALITY OF CONTENT (“The analysis is well-designed and uses the right tools and methods to meet user needs”) alongside the analyst team.\nResponsibilities of the Analyst\nThe analyst team usually work to the SRO. Analysts are responsible for setting up, running, checking and reporting on the analysis.\n* Assist the Commissioner and SRO in framing the question to ensure the right analysis is done.\n* Manage external specialists.\n* Design, build, document and run the analysis.\n* Delivers QUALITY OF CONTENT (“The analysis is well-designed and uses the right tools and methods to meet user needs”) alongside the SRO.\nResponsibilities of the Analytical Assurer\nThe analytical assurer is there to make sure that the analysis has the right level of assurance and that the assurance takes place.\n* Ensures that the evidence is there to demonstrate that appropriate quality assurance has happened and that uncertainty is communicated appropriately.\n* Advises the Commissioner on whether appropriate QA has happened and about any outstanding risks.\n* Involved throughout from design through to use.\n* Delivers QUALITY OF PROCESS (“The analysis does what it is supposed to do and we can prove it”).\nYou can read more about the four roles in the AQuA Book and Verification and Validation for the AQuA Book.",

    "text": "Answering the ONS Quality Questions\nWe have made templates for you to download and use to record your answers to the questions, as well as key project information. There is an Excel template and an editable HTML template.\nSave the template in your project repository or on Sharepoint so that changes can be tracked through version control. You can update it as your analytical work progresses.\nWe encourage the commissioner, analyst team and assurer to contribute response to all the questions that are relevant to their responsibilities. To keep the level of assurance proportionate to your analysis it might be decided that only a subset of questions need be covered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs there any help in deciding which questions should be covered?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe commissioner and lead analyst should agree the level of assurance required and identify which questions are most appropriate together with any possible additional ones.\nThe Excel template has mapped the questions to various categories including Analysis Function’s Quality Questions and Red Flags and the OSR’s Statistical Thinking – both these publications promote their questions as a core set that anyone doing analysis should consider. To identify these questions it is only necessary to filter on the appropriate columns in the worksheet.\nIt is also possible to filter questions relevant for each stage of the Generic Statistical Business Process Model. Many questions are relevant for more than GSBPM stage and only need be answered once!\nWe aim to add further categories to subset questions best suitable for production, research and adhoc projects. These would only be suggestive but could provide a start.\n\n\n\nFor audit purposes, remember to sign and date your responses.\nWhen analysis is due to complete the lead analyst or their designated representative should provide sign-off for the whole template if satisfied that responses provide sufficient assurance of the analysis.",

If the assumption is applied in your code, identify where the assumption applies by citing the module and line number.\n\n\nPlain English description of assumption:\nWrite a clear description of the assumption in plain English. For example, “We assume that our sample of income data is representative for the whole population”.\n\n\nBasis for assumption:\nBriefly summarise why the assumption matters for the analysis and why it is reasonable. For example, the assumption could be based on historical data, theoretical requirements of the method, empirical evidence, quality assurance, common practice or data testing.\n\n\nNumerical value of the assumption:\nIf you can, attach a numerical value to the assumption. This will depend on what the assumption is and how it is applied in your work. For example, you might make an assumption that counts in your data are accurate to within 5 units, so you would record +/- 5 as the numerical value. Thinking about the value of the assumption in numeric terms is a useful way to work through its impact on your work.\n\n\nRange around the estimated value:\nAssumptions are rarely certain. If you can, assign a range to the central value of the assumption.\n\n\nLinks to supporting analysis:\nAttach a link to the source where the assumption comes from or from where it can be verified and justified.\n\n\nDocumentation dependencies:\nList the project documents dealing with this assumption. Assumptions can have an impact on different stages of the analysis. For example, an assumption about input data if valid or in-valid could impact the model code, project timeline, robustness of the outputs produced by the model. Logging these dependencies will ensure that the relevant plans and documents are updated once an assumption is validated.\n\n\nInternally reviewed by:\nEnter the full name of individual or group who reviewed the assumption.\n\n\nDate of last review/update:\nEnter the date the assumption was last reviewed or validated.\n\n\nExternally reviewed by:\nEnter the name of organisation and the position of the expert who validated the assumption. It is not necessary to mention the individual’s name. For example, Lighthouse Laboratory (Senior Scientist), University of Oxford (Professor of Statistics).\n\n\nDate of external review:\nEnter the date the assumption was reviewed by the external expert.\n\n\nNext review/update due on:\nEnter the date the assumption next needs to be reviewed or updated.\n\n\nQuality Rating:\nUse the Quality Rating key (on the Quality and Sensitivity Guide worksheet) to assess quality of assumption as red, amber or green.\n\n\nSensitivity Score:\nUse the Sensitivity Rating key (on the Quality and Sensitivity Guide worksheet) to assess sensitivity as low, medium or high.\n\n\nRisk Score:\nUse the Risk Scoring Guide worksheet to assess the assumption risk as low, medium or high.",

    "section": "Which analysis is in scope of the guidance?",
    "text": "Which analysis is in scope of the guidance?\nThe guidance applies to all analysis workflows, including:\n\nanalysis to support research,\nadvice for other departments,\nad-hoc and one-off outputs\nand regular outputs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegular outputs as business critical models\n\n\n\n\n\nRegular outputs often fulfil at least one of the criteria for what makes a business critical model:\n\nUnderpins essential financial and funding decisions;\n\nEssential to the achievement of business plan actions and priorities;\n\nMust be error free or else risk serious financial or legal penalties or reputational damage for the organisation.\n\nBusiness critical analysis requires the highest level of scrutiny and the governance arrangements must be appropriate for the level of risk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow should the questions be used for ad-hoc analysis?\n\n\n\n\n\nFor ad-hoc outputs with quick turnarounds and limited time and resources, analysis still needs sufficient quality assurance to ensure it is fit for purpose. Ad-hoc outputs are often used as part of the evidence when making important policy decisions, so getting them right is very important.\nWe strongly encourage senior responsible owners of both regular and ad-hoc analysis to answer all questions relevant to their role.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy should these questions and assurance logs be completed?\n\n\n\n\n\nCompleting the logs makes it much easier to understand the risks that the analysis carries and will help you plan to mitigate them. Having a proper audit trail and comprehensive logs also help when:\n\nYou need to explain why the analysis works as it does.\n\nYou need to raise quality and resourcing issues and push back against demands that are unrealistic.\n\nYou need to understand and communicate potential risks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow should I identify the Senior Responsible Owner, Commissioner, Analyst and Analytical Assurer?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe AQuA Book sets out four roles responsible for the assurance of analysis:\n\nCommissioner\n\nSenior Responsible Owner (SRO) (usually leads the analyst team)\n\nAnalysts (who usually report to the SRO) and\n\nAnalytical Assurer.\n\nWhat matters here is that each assurance role is covered in your workflow and that individuals know about and accept their responsibilities, not the name of the role.\nAs a project team, you should make sure that each role is in place and you understand how it will operate for you so that you have the right assurance.\nThe AQuA Book makes no expectations about levels of seniority or grade of each of the occupiers of the roles. It does not specify whether roles should be held by a person or could be held by a committee or other governance group (such as a senior leadership team).\nThe key consideration is whether or not the person or group that undertakes the assurance role have the skills and resources they need to meet the requirements of the role. How the roles are covered in an analysis workflow varies from project to project, depending on how the work is planned, managed and assured.\nWe suggest that if roles are taken by individuals, the SRO and commissioner should usually be at Grade 7 or above. If you are still unsure about how to allocate the roles among your team and governance groups, please email us with “analysis assurance” in the subject header and we will help you to make the decision.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat help is available to answer the quality questions?\n\n\n\n\n\nFor ONS staff, the ONS Quality Central wiki contains lots of useful guidance, templates and mandatory training to help you work through and answer the quality questions. It includes the ONS Quality Standard for Analysis.\nThese cross-government resources are also likely to be useful:\n* Government Data Quality Hub Quality Questions and Red Flags and Government Data Quality Framework\n* Office for Statistics Regulation Quality Assurance of Administrative Data toolkit and Quality and statistics: an OSR perspective.\n* The Uncertainty Toolkit for Analysts in Government",

    "text": "Aims\nThe guidance has five main aims:\n\nTo help analysts understand the level of risk they are carrying in their analytical workflows.\nTo ensure there is a consistent end-to-end QA approach across ONS.\n\nTo make it easier to comply with good practice guidance and standards including the ONS Quality Practices, ONS Quality Standard for Analysis, the government AQUA Book and the Code of Practice for Statistics, the Analysis Function Functional Standard for Analysis and the Government Service Manual which explains how to research, document and validate user needs.\n\nTo ensure there is a consistent understanding of roles and responsibilities when producing high quality analysis and statistics.\n\nTo make it easier to create critical project documentation including an assumptions and decisions log, issue and decisions log, risk register and divisional Quality Improvement Plan.\n\nReflecting on the questions asked in the template will help you to manage your analysis risks:\n\nYou will be able to document the mitigation that is in place or planned.\n\nYou will know which issues and risks the project is prepared to accept and why.\n\nYou can identify potential quality issues and decide how to manage and prioritise them.\n\nHaving this information in once place provides a sound basis for regular reviews of assumptions, issues and risks associated with the workflow, in line with recommended good practice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow the questions draw on other frameworks\n\n\n\n\n\nThe AQuA book sets out a standard framework for managing analytical quality in HM Government. AQuA is there to make sure that our work can be trusted to inform good decision making, while the Code of Practice for Statistics sets out the principles and practices that producers of official statistics should commit to.\nTwo other pieces of guidance have motivated us to produce this template. One is the Analysis Function guidance on Quality Questions and Red Flags. The other is the Office for Statistics Regulation (OSR) guidance on Thinking about quality when producing statistics. Both of these provide sets of questions that analysts can use to interrogate their work and assure its quality.\nBuilding on these resources, this guidance sets out quality questions that are relevant for each stage of analytical cycle. The quality questions are at their most effective if they are asked at the right stage. Once that stage is passed, experience suggests that it is normally difficult to go back and address the points the questions ask by retrofitting at a later stage of the analysis.",
