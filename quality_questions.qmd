This guidance is an ALPHA draft. It is in development and we are still working to ensure that it meets user needs.

Please get in touch with feedback to support the guidance by creating a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/best-practice-and-impact/analysis_project_documentation/issues) or [emailing us](mailto:ASAP@ons.gov.uk).
:::

To get the most out of the template, we strongly recommend that teams identify who will take the key quality assurance roles of Commissioner, Senior Responsible Owner and Analytical Assurer and name the analytical team at the start of the analytical cycle. This is crucial because together these roles help to make sure that the analysis you do is fit-for-purpose.

</tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Q1</td>
  <td>What question does the analysis try to answer?</td>
  <td>A clear understanding of the analysis question is critical. It helps
  your team to scope out requirements, understand the strengths and limitations of the analysis and make sure it is fit for purpose.<br><br>
  If the question is not clear, you risk designing and delivering analysis which does not meet user needs.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Q2</td>
  <td>Why do you need to answer this analysis question?</td>
  <td>Knowing why you need the analysis, what it is for and how it will be used will help you to understand the importance and impact of your work and how it supports decision making.<br><br>It will also help you to make sure the analysis is fit for purpose and correctly answers the question.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Q3</td>
  <td>Which organisational priorities does this analysis address?</td>
  <td>Knowing how the work aligns with organisational priorities shows how it will fit with wider strategic objectives and why you should do the analysis now.<br><br>It informs the level of assurance needed to confirm the work is fit for purpose.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Q4</td>
  <td>If you use a model, is it business critical?</td>
  <td>Identifying if the work is business critical determines the assurance needed to ensure it is fit for purpose.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Q5</td>
  <td>Who needs the answer to the analysis question?</td>
  <td>Knowing what your outputs will be used for can ensure they meet user needs. A good understanding of uses is essential for making sure that your analysis is fit for purpose.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Q6</td>
  <td>Who do you need to consult to make sure you meet the right user
  needs?</td>
  <td>Analysis must be well understood by relevant users, or else
  risks scope creep and misspecification.<br><br>Identify relevant stakeholders and users, consult them before designing the analysis, and consider their views.<br><br>Consulting the right stakeholders helps you and your users agree on how to answer the question and what the output should look like. This means you can check the users' understanding of the process and its quality, and that the final ouput meets user needs.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Q7</td>
  <td>How will you know you have answered the analysis question correctly?</td>
  <td>Being clear about the outputs required and acceptable uncertainty
 is essential for producing accurate and reliable outputs where users understand the work's limitations and uncertainty.<br><br>It is also essential when designing verification and validation activities to check the robustness of results under a range of plausible assumptions about methods and data.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Q8</td>
  <td>What is the estimated time and resource required to answer the analysis question (in months and FTE)?</td>
  <td>Without a clear understanding of time and resources available,
  you may overcommit. It is important to push back against unrealistic demands if there is not enough time to effectively quality assure the analysis.<br><br>The users and commissioner should fully understand and accept increased risks to quality when time and resource pressures are unavoidable.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Q9</td>
  <td>What is the impact if the analysis is not done now?</td>
  <td>Understanding why the work needs to happen now will help you to
  prioritise and use limited resources for the right activities.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Q10</td>
  <td>What is the impact if the analysis is not done correctly?</td>
  <td>Understanding the possible legal, financial or reputational consequences if the analysis is not carried out correctly helps you to design proportionate assurance activities.<br><br>You should consider how these consequences line up with the risk appetite of your organisation when you design your mitigation.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Q11</td>
  <td>Name the commissioner, senior responsible owner and analytical assurer of this analysis?</td>
  <td>Clear accountability makes sure that important decisions are 
  signed off by the right people. There should be a clear understanding of who is responsible for managing, producing and quality assuring the analysis in the team.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Q12</td>
  <td>What tools and resources will you use in production? Are they the best for the job?</td>
  <td>Before starting, identify all the skills and resources needed to produce the final output in a sustainable and reproducible way and quality assure it at every step.<br><br>The platform used to host the analysis and the software to build and run the analysis should be appropriate and risks considered. For example, producing critical outputs in Excel does not comply with best practice and is unlikely to be robust or verifiable.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Q13</td>
  <td>Do you have the right internal and external resources and
  capability to deliver the analysis?</td>
  <td>If the team lacks capability, resource, or time, this increases the risk that the analysis will not be fit for purpose or sufficiently assured.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Q14</td>
  <td>What are the anticipated risks of the analysis?<br><br>Have you
  discussed these risks with customers and stakeholders?</td>
  <td>You must identify potential risks and their impact well in advance to enable effective mitigation and quicker, confident decision-making.<br><br>
  It is important that users understand risks to ensure that their expectations and requirements are met. You should document how you have identified and are monitoring and mitigating risks.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Q15</td>
  <td>Is there a contingency plan prepared if your mitigation plans fail?</td>
  <td >You should account for risks that you can mitigate.  Include risks that have a high impact on the analysis but a low probability happening. Without well designed contingencies, we put quality at risk.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Q16</td>
  <td>Do the data and analysis comply with ethical requirements?</td>
  <td >Analysis must comply with ethics standards to ensure public confidence. You must consider the ethical implications of the analysis when you create the workflow and report your findings.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Q17</td>
  <td>What relevant questions are outside the scope of the analysis?</td>
  <td >Limiting the scope of analysis shapes the quality  of outputs and what can be done with them. By being clear about the limitations of the 
  analysis we can mitigate or accept them. Limitations must be documented so everybody using the analysis is aware of them.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Q18</td>
  <td>How will you peer review and assure the analysis?</td>
  <td>Internal audit and peer review are critical for monitoring and
  assuring that the analysis is performed appropriately and meets the
  required aims and objectives. The outcomes of peer review should be
  documented and relevant actions and recommendations should be prioritised, addressed, and taken forward.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Q19</td>
  <td>Will external experts be involved in development and scrutiny of
  analysis?</td>
  <td >You should commission external specialists to peer review or 
  audit the analysis in proportion to risks around use. They should be able to draw on expertise and experience across government and beyond to get feedback, exchange experience and suggest best practice to improve the analysis.</td>

  <td>What happens if team members, reviewers or users find a mistake in the analysis? Do you have a clear and efficient process for addressing issues and preventing them from happening again?</td>
  <td>Mistakes happen in analysis. You should have a clear and efficient process for reporting, documenting and addressing errors. Being open and honest about problems and working together to solve them in a supportive way creates an atmosphere of openness in the team and is critical for upholding users' trust in your output.<br><br>Teams should take reasonable steps to understand and document how and why errors came about, and mitigate the risk of them happening again. Your mitigation approach should be consistent with your department's revision policies.</td>

  <td>Q25</td>
  <td>Have you assessed uncertainty?</td>
  <td>Consider how uncertainty impacts on all stages of the analysis.
  Think about quantifying and measuring uncertainty as early as possible.
  Identify and review sources of uncertainty regularly.<br><br>If you delay the assessment of uncertainty until late in the process, it is  often difficult and costly to mitigate risks. In some cases, you may need to  revise methods or alter commissioning decisions. If a potential source of uncertainty is overlooked, this can limit the usefulness and impact of the analysis.</td>

<tr>
<td>Q26</td>
  <td>How will the data in the analysis be processed before and during use?</td>
  <td>Processing the data inputs will impact methods and outputs. A clear understanding of how  these processes affect the workflow is essential for understanding quality.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Q27</td>
  <td>Is the data appropriate given the methods selected?</td>
  <td>A comprehensive understanding of data inputs is a prerequisite
  to meeting user needs.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Q28</td>
  <td>What are the strengths and limitations of the data you use?</td>
  <td>Data requirements for analysis vary. Formats, coverage, time scales and granularity must all be appropriate for the research question.<br><br>A comprehensive understanding of data inputs is a prerequisite for meeting user needs.  Without understanding the strengths and weaknesses of the data, it is impossible to make meaningful improvements to the analysis or the inputs to manage these limitations.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Q29</td>
  <td>Is there a robust relationship between your team and data providers?<br><br>Do data providers understand how and why you use their data?</td>
  <td>A good relationship with data suppliers helps to make sure that their data meet your requirements. Lack of communication can mean you are not aware of quality risks or changes in collection or processing steps that can affect your results.<br><br>You should communicate with your suppliers sufficiently to manage input quality. Data providers should have a good understanding of how and why you are using their data. This helps them to improve data quality and value and find and address gaps or issues that are relevant for your analysis.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
 <td>Q30</td>
 <td>Do you understand how data providers collect, process and quality assure the data you use?</td>
 <td>Never assume that datasets are of sufficient quality. Make sure that suppliers give you the metadata and other supporting information you need to assure the quality of the data. Validate the information provided by suppliers using your own checks and confirmation if appropriate.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Q31</td>
  <td>Is there a formal agreement to set out data content, when and how you will get the data? If not, why not?</td>
  <td>A formal service level agreement with data providers makes sure that everybody understands what will be delivered, when and how. This is useful for setting out the division of responsibilities between data providers and your team for getting and sharing the data. It might specify formats, delivery, timescale, legal framework, accompanying metadata and quality checks.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Q32</td>
  <td>Do you know what quality checks are carried out on the data before you receive them?</td>
  <td>Data suppliers should be able to show that their data is sufficiently assured to meet your needs. You should be able to demonstrate that the data meet your needs and that reported quality matches what you observe in practice. Simply having a quality report is not enough.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Q33</td>
  <td>How will you work with your data provider when your data
  requirements change?</td>
  <td>Review your data requirements regularly to ensure they are still relevant and feasible. Changes to requirements should be communicated to data providers well in advance and agreed by all stakeholders. If there is a formal agreement, it may need to be revised as requirements change.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Q34</td>
  <td>How do you know if your data provider changes their systems or processes in a way that could impact the data you receive or the analysis you produce?</td>
  <td>Data suppliers make changes to their definitions, methods and
  systems. This may not affect the quality of their data but can affect how you process the data and what you can infer from it. Tailor communication with data suppliers so it is sufficiently frequent, effective and ongoing to get timely information about changes.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Q35</td>
  <td>How did you choose the methods for the analysis? How do you know
  the methods you use are appropriate?</td>
  <td>You should be able to explain why you chose your methods. For
  each method, document the underlying assumptions, why the method is suitable for answering the analysis question, why it is applicable to the type and distribution of data you are using, and how these decisions were signed off.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr >
  <td>Q36</td>
  <td>Have reasonable alternative methods been explored and rejected for good reasons?</td>
  <td>There is often more than one way to answer a question with data.
  When you have made choices about methods and approaches, explain how and why you considered and rejected other options. Unless there is evidence underpinning your choice, users cannot be sure that you have chosen the most suitable methods.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Q37</td>
  <td>How do you know that your analysis is working correctly?</td>
  <td>You need to be sure that your analysis produces the outputs you think it should and the processes run as expected. If you cannot demonstrate that scripts and processes work correctly, you cannot  confirm the quality of the results.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Q38</td>
  <td>Can you describe the assumptions of your analysis, when they were made and who made them and signed them off?</td>
  <td>You must understand the assumptions your analysis makes. Assumptions set out how the analysis simplifies the world and mitigates uncertainty.  If assumptions are inadequately set out or absent, important characteristics of the analysis and its inputs will be unclear, greatly increasing risk.<br><br>Without a comprehensive log of assumptions made by the analysis, an audit trail signed off by assumption owners, a version control log reflecting when assumptions were last updated, and evidence showing internal and external validation of assumptions, uncertainties may go unacknowledged and could drastically impact outputs.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Q39</td>
  <td>How are assumptions validated and assured before you apply them?</td>
  <td>A clear understanding of how assumptions have been externally and internally validated and signed off gives us confidence that they are reasonable.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Q40</td>
  <td>How do you measure and report uncertainty in your analysis?</td>
  <td>All analysis contains uncertainty. Quantifying and reporting uncertainty means we can inform users how precise reported values are and how much confidence they can have in the analysis. It will also help you to determine where the analysis can be improved.<br><br>There are many ways to quantify uncertainty in input data, assumptions, processes and outputs. Choose appropriate ones for your situation. For instance, uncertainties can be understood and quantified by comparing against similar or historical data, Monte Carlo simulation, break-even analysis or using expert judgement.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Q41</td>
  <td>Have you considered the implications of relevant, unquantified uncertainties?</td>
  <td>A good understanding of the uncertainties in the analysis workflow is critical to ensure the analysis and its outputs are fit for purpose.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Q42</td>
  <td>Can you explain the impact of your analysis on downstream processes? Are there any risks around these dependencies?</td>
  <td>Understanding how your analysis might be used would help ensure 
  that the right quality and assurance levels are in place. It would help you assess the risks around the use of analysis and if there are other  stakeholders or users you need to consult.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Q43</td>
  <td>Is all or part of the analysis reliant on a single person?</td>
  <td>Single points of failure carry significant business risk. If only one person understands how to carry out all or part of the analysis or maintain the code then the process is extremely vulnerable.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Q44</td>
  <td>Is it clear why important decisions about the analysis were made, who made them and when?</td>
  <td>All analysis involves decisions. A comprehensive record of the decisions made in specifying and conducting the analysis ensures a full audit trail of why decisions were made, who made them and signed them off.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Q45</td>
  <td>If changes need to be made to code or datasets, is it easy to track who made the changes and when and why they were made?</td>
  <td>Good version control ensures a full understanding of when, why, and how changes were made to your analysis process. If it is hard to track changes, it will be hard to retrace steps if there is a problem and means you do not fully understand the process</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Q46</td>
  <td>Would another analyst be able to reproduce your analysis output or continue the work without talking to you first?</td>
  <td>Your analysis must be well documented and repeatable so that
  somebody new can understand it, use it, and produce the same output with
  the same inputs. Poor documentation can lead to errors.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Q47</td>
  <td>Do you use internal peer review to check scripts and code, documentation, implementation of methods, processes and outputs?</td>
  <td>You should independently review and validate the logical integrity of you analysis as well as the structure and functionality of the code against the research question.<br><br>A record of validation and verification activities undertaken, outstanding tasks and remedial actions helps to confirm that the correct analysis has been performed for the required purpose and the chosen approach minimises risk.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Q48</td>
  <td>Is your code and analysis ever peer reviewed by someone outside your team or organisation?</td>
  <td>External peer review is one of the best ways to ensure that the analysis and code are well made and fit for purpose. Without it, teams can reinforce their own biases and may not notice there is anything
  wrong.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Q49</td>
  <td>What is your assessment of the quality of your analytical
  outputs?</td>
  <td>Understanding and reporting on the quality of your analysis is critical to ensure fitness for purpose and maintain trust and reliability. This ensures that analysis can appropriately inform decision-making. Quality assessments are key information to  share with users and a requirement of the Code of Practice for Statistics.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Q50</td>
  <td>How do you assure yourselves that analysis you do is correct?</td>
  <td>If you check that results fit with your expectations and you can explain discrepancies, this makes it easier to mitigate risk.<br><br>There are many ways to check if analysis is carried out correctly. For example, sensitivity analysis can help you understand which inputs have the greatest effect on the outputs.You can also compare figures from the analysis with similar data from other sources or from historical series.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Q51</td>
  <td>Do the outputs of your analysis align with similar findings from 
  elsewhere? If not, can you explain why?</td>
  <td> If you can, check that your outputs align with findings from previous runs of the analysis, alternate data sources, and comparable
  studies. This gives you confidence that the analysis works as expected. You should be able to explain any inconsistencies that you see.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Q52</td>
  <td>If you find outliers or unusual trends in the data, what steps do you take to investigate them?</td>
  <td>It is crucial to check unusual trends and values in the data and
  understand why they are there. Not all outliers are the same. Some have a strong influence, some not at all. Some are valid and important data values. Others might be errors.<br><br>Investigate outliers and unusual patterns thoroughly and take reasonable steps to check their impact on your final output. If you choose to exclude unusual values, you should explain why this is acceptable.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
 <td>Q53</td>
  <td>Can you give a clear account of what can and cannot be inferred from the analysis?</td>
  <td>Often the aim of final output is to inform decison-making. Output might include  predictions, involving lots of underlying assumptions. It is critical that  you support your users to make appropriate use of outputs and understand what  can and cannot be inferred. Without this, users may misinterpret findings,  make in appropriate comparisons, use the analysis for unsuitable purposes and arrive at the wrong conclusions. For example, a non-expert user may wrongly interpret correlation as causation or use incomplete or disconnected data to make forecasts. </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Q54</td>
  <td>Have you assessed the limitations of the data and analysis and set out how they affect the quality and use of the outputs?</td>
  <td>You should describe why limitations related to data and methods exist, why they cannot be overcome using the chosen approach and their impact on the quality and interpretation of the output.  Analysis is of very little value if limitations aren't properly documented and explained.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Q55</td>
  <td>Have you sense checked outputs with user groups and stakeholders?</td>
  <td>You should work with users, experts, and other relevant stakeholders to verify the credibility of outputs and sense check that they are useful.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Q56</td>
  <td>Is uncertainty about data quality, assumptions and methodology clearly communicated to users?</td>
  <td>Outputs are never 100% accurate. Users need to understand how uncertainties related to data, assumptions and methodology feed into and through the analysis workflow and what this means for the use of the outputs. Results must clearly explain how uncertainty affects the findings from the analysis, or we risk misinterpretations and conclusions being overly reliant on imprecise results.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Q57</td>
  <td>Are the implications of unquantified uncertainties communicated to users?</td>
  <td>You must support your users to understand relevant uncertainties which are not captured in the analysis. When you can, make reasonable judgements about the likely size and direction of unquantified uncertainty. Provide a qualitative description informing users about why the uncertainty cannot be quantified and  their likely impact.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Q58</td>
  <td>Is workflow documentation including technical guides and code repositories publicly available?</td>
  <td>Transparency about your analysis supports proper scrutiny and challenge, promotes public trust, and encourages re-use of the resources you develop.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Q59</td>
  <td>Does the technical guide and documentation explain how to run the analysis to obtain valid outputs?</td>
  <td>A good technical guide helps everybody to understand what the analysis does and how it works. A well-written technical guide is essential for effective maintenance of the analysis. It helps users of the analysis to replicate the findings, get answers to methodology questions and build their trust in the output.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Q60</td>
  <td>Have you fully documented the analysis code to comply with good practice?</td>
  <td>The technical guide is complemented by fully documented analysis code. Code documentation must comply with good practice so new users can understand and execute the code as easily and quickly as possible.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Q61</td>
  <td>Are users able to feed back on the suitability of outputs?</td>
  <td>External critique makes analysis more robust. Users should be able to give feedback to your team to ensure that results meet their needs. User feedback and customer reviews inform you of issues and changes that you might need to make. They also act as evidence that users have been consulted.</td>
